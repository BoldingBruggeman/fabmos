# Installation

```
python -m pip install <REPODIR>
```

To install in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/local-project-installs/) (the fabmos module code is directly run from the repository directory, which makes it easy to make changes and see their impact during development, without reinstallation):

```
python -m pip install -e <REPODIR>
```

# Removal

```
python -m pip uninstall fabmos
```
